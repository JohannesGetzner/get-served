# Welcome to *Get Served*!

## An awesome mini-game, where your skills as a waiter are tested against a horde of impatient guests.

The game was built using the libGDX Java library and is completely based on open source assets. Gradle is used to build
the game and should take care of all dependencies. At the time of developing this game `libGDX 1.9.10` was used.
